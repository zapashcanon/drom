=====

The :code:`drom` tool is a wrapper over :code:`opam`/:code:`dune` in
an attempt to provide a :code:`cargo`-like user experience. It can be
used to create full OCaml projects with sphinx and odoc
documentation. It has specific knowledge of Github and will generate
files for Github Actions CI and Github pages.
